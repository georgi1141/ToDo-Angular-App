# ToDo-Angular-App

An app that I made to train my new skills with Angular.

I have used Bootstrap for styling of the components and a fake json-web server for REST API calls.

To run the app , clone the repo and run 'npm i' to install dependancies, then run 'json-server --watch db.json' in order to CRUD from the db.json file ,finally run 'ng serve' to run the app. Open your browser on the port that the app would run(4200 on default). 

You can create a list of Todo items , you can also delete or edit by opening a modal.
